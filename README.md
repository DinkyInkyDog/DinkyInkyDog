- 👋 Hi, I’m Lauren Andrews
- 👀 I’m interested in dogs. I love everything about them and could talk about them for hours.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, but I have a B.S in Digital Media and just completed the Promineo Tech Back-end Developer bootcamp.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on just about anything. 
- 📫 The best way to reach me is through LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauren-andrews-36310a300/
